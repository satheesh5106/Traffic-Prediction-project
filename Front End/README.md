This folder encompasses the entire frontend application, built to provide a rich and interactive user experience. It leverages modern web technologies to deliver a responsive and performant interface, integrating seamlessly with the backend services. The structure is designed for modularity, reusability, and ease of development.

Contents:

*   app/: This directory typically contains the main application pages and their routing logic. It defines the core navigation and layout of the application.

    *   auth/: Contains pages related to authentication, such as login and registration interfaces. This ensures a dedicated space for user authentication flows.

    *   dashboard/: Houses the main dashboard pages, which provide an overview and access to various features and data visualizations. This includes client-specific dashboards and standalone versions.

    *   globals.css: Global CSS styles that apply across the entire application, ensuring consistent styling.

    *   layout.tsx: Defines the main layout structure of the application, including headers, footers, and navigation elements that are common across multiple pages.

    *   page.tsx: Represents the main entry point or a primary page of the application.

*   components/: This directory is a collection of reusable UI components that can be composed to build complex interfaces. It promotes consistency and accelerates development.

    *   3d/: Contains components for 3D visualizations or interactive elements, such as a CityMap component.

    *   ClientAuthProvider.tsx: A component responsible for providing authentication context to client-side components.

    *   animations/: Houses components that implement various animations, such as Lottie animations, to enhance user engagement.

    *   auth/: Specific UI components related to authentication, like modal dialogs for login or registration.
