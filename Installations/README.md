This folder is dedicated to managing project dependencies and ensuring consistent development environments across all contributors. It contains configuration files for package management, which are crucial for setting up and running the project correctly.

Contents:

*   package.json: This file defines the project's metadata, scripts, and a list of all direct dependencies required for the main application. It specifies the versions of packages that the project relies on, ensuring that the correct libraries are installed.

*   package-lock.json: Automatically generated by npm (Node Package Manager), this file records the exact version of each dependency, including transitive dependencies, that was installed. Its purpose is to ensure that subsequent installations produce an identical `node_modules` tree, preventing potential version conflicts and ensuring build reproducibility.

*   package.dashboard.json: This is likely a separate `package.json` file specifically for the dashboard part of the project. It would contain dependencies and scripts unique to the dashboard application, allowing for independent management of its environment.

To set up the project's dependencies, navigate to this directory and run the appropriate package manager command (e.g., `npm install` or `yarn install`). This will install all necessary packages as defined in the `package.json` files.

This centralized approach to dependency management helps in maintaining a stable and predictable development environment, reducing setup time and minimizing compatibility issues.
