*   **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration for database connections, API keys, and other environment-specific settings.

### Authentication Features

*   **User Registration**: Allows new users to create accounts securely with validation and password hashing.
*   **User Login**: Provides secure login mechanisms, supporting both traditional email/password and potentially third-party authentication (e.g., Google OAuth, Firebase).
*   **Password Reset**: Implements a secure process for users to reset forgotten passwords.
*   **Session Management**: Manages user sessions securely, including token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for stateless API interactions.
*   **Middleware Protection**: Utilizes middleware to protect sensitive routes and ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access specific resources.
*   **Input Validation**: Robust validation scripts to ensure the integrity and security of user-provided data during registration and login.

## 3. Development Process

### Frontend Development Steps

1.  **Project Setup**: Initialized the Next.js project and configured essential development tools like ESLint, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS.
2.  **Component-Based Architecture**: Designed and developed reusable React components for various UI elements, including navigation, data visualization, and interactive sections.
3.  **Page Development**: Created distinct pages for authentication (login, register, reset password) and the main dashboard, ensuring seamless navigation.
4.  **State Management**: Implemented custom hooks (e.g., `use-toast.ts`, `useScrollAnimation.ts`) for managing UI state, animations, and user feedback.
5.  **API Integration**: Connected frontend components to backend APIs for data fetching and submission, ensuring proper data flow and error handling.
6.  **Styling and Responsiveness**: Applied global styles and component-specific styling using CSS and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across devices.

### Backend Development Steps

1.  **API Design**: Defined the API endpoints and data models necessary to support frontend functionalities.
2.  **Controller and Service Layer Implementation**: Developed controllers to handle incoming requests and services to encapsulate business logic and interact with the database.
3.  **Middleware Development**: Created custom middleware for request logging, error handling, and security checks.
4.  **Database Integration**: Set up and configured the database connection, defining schemas and implementing CRUD operations.
5.  **Authentication Integration**: Integrated the authentication logic, including user registration, login, and token validation, with the backend services.
6.  **Testing and Debugging**: Conducted thorough testing of API endpoints and backend logic to ensure reliability and performance.

### Authentication Implementation Steps

1.  **Schema Definition**: Defined user data models and authentication-related schemas.
2.  **Registration Flow**: Implemented user registration with secure password hashing and validation.
3.  **Login Flow**: Developed the login mechanism, generating secure tokens upon successful authentication.
4.  **Session Management**: Implemented token-based session management to maintain user sessions across requests.
5.  **Middleware for Protection**: Created authentication middleware to protect routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access specific resources.
6.  **Third-Party Integration (if applicable)**: Configured and integrated Firebase Authentication and Google OAuth for alternative login methods, managing redirect URIs and API keys.

## 4. Technologies Used
