This folder serves as the root for all static assets and publicly accessible files within the application. Content placed here is directly served by the web server and is not processed by the Next.js build pipeline, making it ideal for images, fonts, and other static resources. It also houses specific public-facing sections of the application.

Contents:

*   authentication/: This subdirectory may contain static assets or files specifically related to the authentication process, such as background images for login pages or public-facing authentication-related content.

*   dashboard/: Contains static assets and client-side files for the dashboard interface. These resources are directly accessible and support the dashboard's functionality and styling.

    *   dashboard_navigation.js: JavaScript for handling navigation within the dashboard.

    *   dashboard_styles.css: CSS styles specifically for the dashboard layout and components.

    *   data_visualization_components.js: JavaScript components for rendering data visualizations on the dashboard.

    *   main_dashboard_layout.html: The main HTML structure for the dashboard, defining its overall layout.

    *   user_profile_section.js: JavaScript for managing and displaying user profile information within the dashboard.

*   landing-page/: This subdirectory holds all the static files necessary for the application's landing page. These files are designed to be publicly accessible and provide an engaging introduction to the application.

    *   index.html: The main HTML file for the landing page.

    *   landing_page_animations.js: JavaScript for interactive animations on the landing page.

    *   landing_page_script.js: General JavaScript functionalities for the landing page.

    *   landing_page_styles.css: CSS styles for the visual presentation of the landing page.

    *   welcome_content.txt: Text content for the welcome section of the landing page.

This structure ensures that public assets are efficiently served and organized, contributing to faster load times and a streamlined user experience for static content.
