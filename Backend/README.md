This folder contains the core backend services and API logic for the application. It is responsible for handling data processing, business logic, database interactions, and serving API endpoints to the frontend. The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, ensuring efficient and secure operations.

Contents:

*   src/: This directory encapsulates the main source code for the backend application, organized into distinct functional modules.

    *   config/: Contains configuration files for various services and settings, such as database connections, API keys, and environment-specific variables. This ensures that sensitive information and customizable parameters are managed centrally.

    *   controllers/: Houses the logic for handling incoming requests and preparing responses. Controllers interact with services to process data and orchestrate the flow of information between the client and the backend.

    *   middleware/: Includes middleware functions that process requests before they reach the controllers or responses before they are sent to the client. This is used for tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and data validation.

    *   routes/: Defines the API endpoints and their corresponding handlers. This module maps URLs to specific controller functions, structuring the application's API surface and ensuring proper request routing.

    *   utils/: Provides utility functions and helper modules that are commonly used across different parts of the backend. This includes reusable code for tasks like data formatting, encryption, or external service integrations.

*   package.json: This file lists the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata. It is essential for managing the backend's development environment and ensuring that all required packages are installed correctly.

*   Backend_structure.txt: A document detailing the intended directory structure and organizational principles of the backend module.

This backend structure promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend. It supports robust API development and efficient data management for the entire application.
